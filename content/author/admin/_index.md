Hi, I'm Mikayla.

I'm a recent graduate of Stanford University (2019), where I studied Management Science & Engineering. 

I am interested in tooling to build production machine learning systems, including model serialization, versioning, and deployment. I currently work primarily in python and pyspark. 

Note: The projects on this site are a bit outdated (in terms of the work that I currently do) and don't reflect the current tooling I use. However, I think it does show the passion I have for this field and my committment to continuous learning in whatever I do. I love open-source development and sharing the projects I have worked on. More recent examples of my work are on my Github.
