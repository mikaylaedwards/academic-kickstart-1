See the Github Repo for this project here: https://github.com/mikaylaedwards/flask_model

I have embedded the deployed model below, though it may take a minute to load.

It can also be accessed here: https://marketing-model.herokuapp.com/

To get a prediction back, you can change selections in the dropdowns and press submit. The API will return the prediction and probability estimate from the model.
